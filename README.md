# A Multi-Task Approach to Stress-Detection

Predicting stress levels in humans accurately could offer numerous potential benefits in the clinical realm. However, conventional machine learning methodologies often fail to deliver high performance in this specific field. This shortfall is likely due to the unsuitability of a universal machine learning model in forecasting phenomena such as mood and stress, which display significant variability due to individual distinctions. Hence, in this repository, we leverage Multitask Learning (MTL) strategies to construct tailor-made machine learning models.

We facilitate this by categorizing individuals into clusters based on similar personality traits, then applying the multitask methodologies to these groups. We find the approach significantly effective.
